Basic rules:

At the start of the game Player One places their ships one at a time, once all player ones ships have been placed the ai (player two) will place all their ships. The player will then select a water tile on the Player Two board which will act as the attack phase. The turn will then change to player two, and so on untill a player has sunks all the others ships.

I used these two to help me with logic and figuring out how to best layout the code.

Technologies Used:

Javascript, HTML, CSS

Next Steps:

I plan to add better functionality for the ai so when it finds a ship it will switch into a 'target' mode. I want to add timeoouts so the ai doesn'm immediatly go and allows the message to update.
